# Review 

Not only does IScream have delicious ice cream to satisfy your sweet tooth, but just walking into IScream within itself is a treat. It is filled with wonderful aromas of rich ice cream flavors and freshly baked waffle cones. There are more ice cream flavors than one can count all with their own rich and unique taste. My personal flavor is the strawberry. It is a pleasant rich and creamy strawberry flavor that is sure to leave you wanting more. The waffle cone is crunchy and delicious and is the right way to end off your ice cream adventure at IScream. I call it an adventure because thats what it truly is. It is not just an Ice cream shop it is an experience. Somewhere you go out of your way to visit when you are close by, and even if you aren't close by the travel is well worth it.
