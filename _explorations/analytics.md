My Website was not visited a ton, I had 4 different users all look at my website, with most of the web traffic being on Monday February 19. All of the users were in the United States. I have had consistent visitors to the website for the course of the week, but most of the peak was on monday. Between the 4 visitors they visited the website 88 different times as shown on the graph below. If I was an actual restaurant owner I honestly would not be happy with these results. Now I know the scenario is different, but as an actual owner I would attempt to creat more of an online presence to try to creat more traction for my website. I may creat a tiktok and twitter accounts to help spread the word about my place and try to bring more eyeballs to our restaurant.
