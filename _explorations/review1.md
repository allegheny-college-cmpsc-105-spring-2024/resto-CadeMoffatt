# Review

Audrey's Appetizers is great restaurant, it is the perfect place to go to with friends for dinner and a good time. There are plenty of different appetizers all to share with your group of friends. All of the appetizers are fantastic, however my recommendation is to order the app sampler. It gives you a plethora of options to choose from. My favorites are specifically the mozzarella sticks which have a are crispy and full of delicious melty cheese and the buffalo boneless chicken wings. The sauce is a perfect mixture of spice balanced with a delicious flavor that will certainly make you want to fight over the last one. The establishment is run great, and the place is always very clean and the staff is very friendly. One thing is for sure every time you decide to visit Audrey's, you will be leaving with a belly full of delicious food and memories of a good time.
