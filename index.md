> Bobby Mo's has a very homely atmosphere that is sure to give you a nostalgic feel. Their classic american style food with their burgers and homey entrees like their chicken cordon bleu. My personal favorite is the mac n' cheese with its rich and creamy flavor it is sure to give anyone a desire to come back.

> I've been to Bobby Mo's over a dozen times, and I swear it gets better each time. My kids have had birthday parties here and it is always a pleasure, the staff is always so nice and the place is very clean. The food is the icing on the cake at this already wonderful establishment. Between the Oreo Cookie milkshake and the Bacon Cheeseburger I almost never want to eat anywhere else!
